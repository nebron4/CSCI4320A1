In order to run the file you have to make sure that package edu.clayton.csit.antlab.person; is above the 
import java.util.*; once you do that you should be able to run the program 

I also commented out lines 37-62 to test out the program to make sure that it runs so that should be left commented out until I implement the next portion of the code
